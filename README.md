## Title: IRIS Dataset Advanced Visualizations

This repository contains an advanced data visualization project using Python with the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and data analysis, and in this project, I've taken it a step further by implementing advanced visualization techniques to gain deeper insights.

### A. Dataset Description: 
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for each sample. The dataset is often used for classification and clustering tasks.

We will be using the following dataset:

      Iris.csv

### B. Advanced Visualization Techniques:
In this project, I've applied advanced data visualization techniques such as:

      1. Scatter plots with color-coded data points for feature analysis.
      2. Heatmaps and correlation matrices to identify relationships between features.
      3. Pairplot to displays pairwise relationships between multiple numeric attributes in the dataset.
